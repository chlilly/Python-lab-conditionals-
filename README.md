A typical Fizz-Buzz problem goes like this:

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 - 100. For each multiple of three print "Fizz" instead of the number. For multiples of five print "Buzz" instead of the number. If a number is a multiple of three and five then print "FizzBuzz".

Solving this problem requires 2 key components: looping and conditionals. We're going to write a simplified program only using the conditional portion that will take any given number that we provide and print the Fizz-Buzz value.
