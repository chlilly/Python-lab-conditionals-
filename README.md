A typical Fizz-Buzz problem goes like this:

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 - 100. For each multiple of three print "Fizz" instead of the number. For multiples of five print "Buzz" instead of the number. If a number is a multiple of three and five then print "FizzBuzz".

Solving this problem requires 2 key components: looping and conditionals. We're going to write a simplified program only using the conditional portion that will take any given number that we provide and print the Fizz-Buzz value. 

Here's how it will work:

$ ./fizz-buzz-item.py
Enter an integer value: 15
FizzBuzz
$ ./fizz-buzz-item.py
Enter an integer value: 21
Fizz
$ ./fizz-buzz-item.py
Enter an integer value: 17
